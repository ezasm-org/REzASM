# REzASM
## A Rust port of [EzASM](https://github.com/ezasm-org/ezasm/tree/main)
"Rewrite it in Rust," and so we did.

## Introduction
The goal of this project is to create a small-instruction-set programming language interpreter written in Rust with a GUI interface for inspecting the current state of the environment. This simple interpreted language would be able to demonstrate the concepts of a lower level assembly language while still being easier to write. The instructions would be intuitive and simple compared to MIPS (e.g., no system calls or immediate limits) and act upon virtual registers akin to other assembly languages.

## Getting Started (Windows)
1. Go to rust-lang.org and [install](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started) rust
2. Download and install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
3. Download the [Visual Studio Installer](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) and install the Desktop Development with C++ Workload
4. Using a terminal emualtor of your choice, install cargo-tauri using `cargo install tauri-cli` 
5. Use your terminal emulator to install tailwindcss using `npm install -g tailwindcss`
6. Clone this repository using whatever method you prefer
7. View this repository in your terminal emulator
8. Run `npm i` in your terminal emulator
9. Run the application using `cargo tauri dev`

## Getting Started (Linux)
1. Install Rust using your package manager
    - If your package manager doesn't have Rust in a repo you trust, go to [this site](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started) and follow the instructions there
2. Install NodeJS using your package manager
    - If your package manager doesn't have NodeJS in a repo you trust, go to [this site](https://nodejs.org/en/download) and follow the instructions there
3. Install cargo-tauri using `cargo install tauri-cli`
4. Install tailwindcss using `npm install -g tailwindcss`
5. Clone this repository using whatever method you prefer
6. View this repository in your terminal
